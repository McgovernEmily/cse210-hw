# Final Project - Protein Tracker

This contains a protein tracker program that will ask the user for weight, gender, activity, and name of the user. It will give a recommended protein intake, but the user can add their personal goal if they choose.

* The user will be asked if they already have an account saved in the file, if not they they will make one.
* Then, the user can input meals and protein as they choose.
* When they are finished, they can see their progress.
* If the user finishes inputting their desired meals, then they need to save their progress. Then, they can exit the program.
* When user comes back, they will input their name to make sure they have an account.
* Once they are in the program fully (menu), then they can load their info from the file.
* When they want to reset their protein goal after they complete it, they can select reset.
